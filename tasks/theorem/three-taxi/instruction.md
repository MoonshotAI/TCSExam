# Task: Constant-competitive online 3-taxi on general metrics

A Lean 4 (with mathlib) project lives in `/app`. `Task/Basic.lean`
contains a definition layer and exactly one theorem, stated in full and
"proved" by `sorry` inside a marked slot. **Prove that theorem.**

The theorem comes from online algorithms. In the (hard) `k`-taxi
problem, `k` taxis move in a metric space and must serve online requests
`(r, s)`: some taxi must move to the pick-up point `r` (this empty
movement is the only cost) and is then relocated to `s` for free. The
theorem states: there is a constant `κ > 0` such that the algorithm
TripodTracker for `k = 3`, as given by the trajectory semantics of the
definition layer, has total online cost at most `κ` times the total
offline cost (no additive constant), for every initial state with
coinciding online/offline configurations and zero intervals and every
request sequence paired with offline choices.

## Rules

- For verifier safety, executable commands `#eval`, `#exec`, `#exit`, and
  `#compile` are not allowed in submitted Lean files, including harmless
  diagnostics. Remove these commands before submission; the verifier rejects
  them before compiling the proof.
- Do not modify anything above the line `-- END OF FIXED PART`, the
  theorem statement, or the `-- CHECKPOINT ...` marker lines.
- You may add your own auxiliary definitions and lemmas below the
  `-- END OF FIXED PART` line, outside the checkpoint slot.
- No new `axiom` declarations and no `native_decide`; the verifier
  rejects these lexically. `sorry`/`admit` left in the theorem slot
  score 0. A `sorry` in your own auxiliary lemmas is not scanned for,
  but if the main theorem's proof depends on it, the `#print axioms`
  check fails (`sorryAx` is never allowed) and the score is 0.
- The project builds offline against the mathlib checkout at
  `/opt/lean-lib/mathlib4`; use `lake build Task` in `/app` to check.
- No `notation` / `macro` / `syntax` / `elab` / `macro_rules` /
  `initialize` declarations anywhere in your solution — they are
  rejected as semantic-layer rewriting.
- You may create auxiliary/scratch files (e.g. under `/app/Task/` or
  `/tmp`) for exploration, but do not import them from
  `Task/Basic.lean` — an `import` line at the top of
  `Task/Basic.lean` counts as a change to the fixed part and scores
  0. Auxiliary content used by the main proof must live below the
  `-- END OF FIXED PART` line in `Task/Basic.lean` itself.

## Scoring

All-or-nothing: the score is 1 if the project compiles with the theorem
proved (no `sorry`) using only the standard axioms, and 0 otherwise.

## Notes

- Time budget: you have up to **12 hours** of wall-clock time for this task; the run is terminated when it expires.
